# Vimbundles

These are the bundles that I am currently using.
They are submodules of this repository.

## Getting Started

* Clone into ~/.vimbundles, or clone and symlink ~/.vimbundles to your location

```
git clone https://github.com/timcmartin/vimbundles.git .vimbundles
cd ~/.vimbundles
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
